# ijhttp tools: Maven Plugin and Spring Boot Test autoconfiguration

I had started with Maven Plugin to run HTTP requests on the <em>integration-test</em> phase
using the [IntelliJ HTTP Client][http-client]. Later I added Spring Boot Test autoconfiguration,
thanks [@GoncaloPT][GoncaloPT] for [his idea][leverage-test].

## Getting started

Originally the IntelliJ HTTP Client plugin allows to create, edit, and execute HTTP requests
directly in the IntelliJ IDEA code editor.
The IntelliJ HTTP Client is also [available as a CLI tool][cli-tool].

The plugin allows to run HTTP requests on the <em>integration-test</em> phase
using the IntelliJ HTTP Client. The autoconfiguration allows to run them with Spring Boot Test,
you don't need to package and run whole application.

The [HTTP Request in Editor Specification][specification]
describes format these files.

Example requests:

```language-apex
GET https://example.com/api/get

### Add an item
POST https://example.com/api/add
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "entity",
  "value": "content"
}
```

### Directories

**IntelliJ HTTP Client** needs HTTP files to work.
With **HTTP Client Command Line** you can set directories that contain such files.
